# CoVarePlots
CoVarPlots - Covarage Variant Plots for viral whole genome sequencing


This script was created as part of the interARTIC project, and is the code that generates the output plots. 

Input currently only supports that generated by the artic pipelines, but should work for any virus, or primer scheme you have used.

Plans to generate depth plots from bam file is on the TODO list

Feedback is welcome.
